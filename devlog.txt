Doing some basic project setup for eclipse. Create some
directories. Wrote a rake script that downloads Mahout and unpacks it
in the build directory and then updates the .classpath (used by
Eclipse) to point at it's jars and src. This is in prepartion for the
next step, i.e. running the learned decision tree forest over the
image set to find matches. I antisipate that this will require writing
some custom java code and slotting it into Mahout.

The current instructions for setting up the project after checking it out are:

1. rake
2. import the project into eclipse

It should be linked to the jars and src inside mahout.
